    <div class="biog">
      <p>I am a front-end web developer with intermediate skills in HTML & CSS, Javascript & React.</p>
      <p>In 2020 I completed a full stack web development course with <a href="https://www.thejump.tech/"
          target="_blank">The Jump</a>
        where I learnt to develop & deploy full-stack web applications &
        websites. Through this 38 week course I expanded front-end skills (HTML, CSS & Javascript including React) and
        learnt
        new skills in server-side and back-end web development. I felt creatively invigorated and could start to see how
        competency in coding could open up new avenues for live experiences.</p>
      <p>
        In same year I created a piece of software as part of a creative process with Figs in Wigs - <a
          href="https://www.astrologybingo.com/" target="_blank"> Astrology Bingo</a>. First
        written in vanilla Javascript and subsequently in React, it uses an API to create and print birth charts and run
        a bingo
        game. Which translates to, a room of 100 people all playing bingo live, using their own personal astrological
        birth
        charts as bingo cards! AB is now on a UK tour (inc Shoreditch Town Hall, Norfolk & Norwich Fest & Colchester
        Arts).
      </p>
      <p>As a creative programmer I work with companies that use digital elements to facilitate live experiences. In
        2021
        I
        worked with NPO <a href="https://coneyhq.org/h/" target="_blank">Coney</a> to create Afterlife, a piece
        co-created with Headlong
        & National Theatre, inviting
        participants to
        decide which memory they’d choose to spend their eternity within. In 2021 I worked with NPO Blast Theory as a
        Junior
        React Programmer, working with their Software Lead to re-write location-based audio experience, Fixing Point.
      </p>
      <p>I am one core artistic team of all-female performance collective <a href="https://www.figsinwigs.com"
          target="_blank">Figs
          in
          Wigs</a>. My role spans performance, co-direction & producing, as well as leading on sound design and
        digital
        elements
        (web
        development, graphic design, video editing). Most shows by Figs in Wigs include at least one strange sound piece
        and weird video that I has created. I also often design print for Figs’ shows and club nights and over the years
        have built a bizarre oeuvre of clunky, naff, visually arresting designs that have fed into the Figs in Wigs
        aesthetic.
